The AI model identified 13 targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 10 (Adaptation)**: Develop or update district-level DRR plans in ≥ 30 high-risk districts, strengthening early warning systems

-   **Overall Resilience & Water Access 1**: Reduce climate-related disaster risks (droughts, floods)

-   **Coastal, Marine & Fisheries 2**: Improve early warning systems (sea-level rise, extreme weather)

-   **Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) 1**: Strengthen integrated DRR

-   **Multi-Hazard Early Warning System Enhancement**: Improve multi-hazard, end-to-end and people-centred early warning systems

-   **Climate Change Disaster Risk Management**: Increase understanding and management of climate change-related disaster risks

-   **Financing for Disaster Risk Management**: Enhance public and private financing and investments in disaster risk management

-   **Climate Change Technology and Innovation**: Promote technologies and innovation for managing climate change related disaster risks

-   **Recovery and Reconstruction Capacity Building**: Strengthen capacity for build back better in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction for community resilience

-   **Target 6**: Reduce the rates of introduction of invasive alien species by 50% and minimize their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services by 2030

-   **Objective 3 (Adaptation)**: Strengthen disaster risk management and early warning systems for climate extremes, including community-level outreach.

-   **Objective 4 (Adaptation)**: Undertake risk & vulnerability mapping for land-use planning, focusing on flood-prone and coastal hazard areas.

-   **Pollution and Habitat Protection**: Reduce habitat degradation and pollution levels, manage invasive species

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 26 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl6)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
