#### Sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions that promote inclusive, equitable, and environmentally sustainable development while ensuring that present needs are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. It covers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs, which integrate social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Efforts include poverty eradication, food and water security, universal access to education and healthcare, sustainable economic growth, sustainable infrastructure and urbanization, responsible consumption and production, access to clean energy, reduction of inequalities, promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions, and fostering partnerships. It also includes aligning national strategies with the SDGs, strengthening institutions to deliver on them, integrating SDG indicators into monitoring and reporting systems, ensuring policy coherence across sectors, and promoting cross-cutting solutions that address multiple goals simultaneously, including biodiversity conservation, climate action, and gender equality.

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Land degradation (LDN), all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP), and all targets that pertain to Climate Change (NDC). Of these, 108 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl18)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets (NBT) and the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) exhibit significant alignment in promoting sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). For instance, both policies emphasize the importance of integrated biodiversity-inclusive spatial planning and the restoration of degraded ecosystems, which could enhance ecological integrity and resilience to climate change. Additionally, the NDC's focus on mainstreaming climate change considerations into agriculture complements the NBT's targets aimed at sustainable management of land and resources. However, while the NDC targets address climate adaptation and risk management, the NBT targets appear to focus more on biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, suggesting a potential area for further integration. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for cohesive policy implementation that supports both biodiversity and climate resilience.
