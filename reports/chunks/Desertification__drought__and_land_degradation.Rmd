#### Desertification, drought, and land degradation

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions to address desertification and the effects of drought, especially in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. It also includes the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), which strives for a balance between land degradation and land restoration, ensuring that any land degradation is offset by the restoration of an equivalent area. Avoiding new degradation of land by maintaining existing healthy land, reducing existing degradation by adopting sustainable land management practices (i.e. Nature based Solutions), maintaining soil health, ramping up efforts to restore and return degraded lands to a natural or more productive state. This approach promotes long-term environmental sustainability, supports the restoration of ecosystem services, and contributes to the achievement of Rio Conventions global targets.

The AI model identified nine targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **LDN Target 2**: Restore and improve degraded forest (80% in the dry zone and 20% in the wet zone)

-   **LDN Target 4**: Reduce rate of soil degradation to improve land productivity and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks



​

**LDN targets**:

-   **NBT 2**: Ensure that by 2030 at least 30% of degraded terrestrial, inland waters, coastal, and marine ecosystems are identified and under appropriate restoration initiatives including enhanced connectivity and buffering, using relevant methods, recovery plans, monitoring, adequate resources, and inter-agency cooperation, to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity, and connectivity

-   **NBT 8**: Minimize the impact of climate change on all levels of biodiversity, and increase their resilience through mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and habitat conservation; supported by nature-based solutions, and ecosystem-based approaches, while minimizing negative and fostering positive impacts of climate action on biodiversity

-   **NBT 10**: Ensure that areas under agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, mining, tourism, renewable energy generation, and forestry are managed sustainably and cause minimum impact on ecosystems and wild species; promoting food security, all forms of nature-based tourism; conserving and restoring biodiversity, and maintaining ecosystem functions and services to benefit people

-   **NBT 11**: Restore, maintain and enhance nature’s contributions to people, such as ecosystem functions and services, by the use of nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches, for the benefit of all people and nature



​

**NBSAP targets**:

-   **Biodiversity NDC 1**: Identification and management of climate-sensitive areas, and restoration of degraded areas inside and outside protected area (PA) network to conserve habitats that are highly vulnerable to climate change

-   **Forestry NDC 1**: Sustainable management of forest and restoration of other degraded lands, at least 32% by 2035

-   **Water NDC 2**: Ground water and surface water monitoring and vulnerability assessment in high sensitive and drought-prone areas of the country and implementing remedial measures

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Land degradation (LDN), all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP), and all targets that pertain to Climate Change (NDC). Of these, 22 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl13)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets across the Land Degradation Neutrality Targets for Sri Lanka, Nature-Based Tourism (NBT), and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) policies exhibit notable alignment in addressing desertification, drought, and land degradation. For instance, the NDC's commitment to sustainable forest management and restoration aligns with the Land Degradation Neutrality target of restoring degraded forests, highlighting a shared focus on enhancing land productivity and ecosystem health. Additionally, the NBT's emphasis on identifying and restoring degraded ecosystems complements the NDC's approach to managing climate-sensitive areas, suggesting potential synergies in ecosystem restoration efforts. Overall, these policies collectively promote sustainable land management practices, which could enhance resilience against climate change impacts while fostering biodiversity and ecosystem services.
