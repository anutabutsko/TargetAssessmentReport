**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 2 (Adaptation)**: Demarcate and protect 60% of major water sources in all 9 basins to strengthen water resilience

-   **Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) 1**: Adopt climate-smart integrated water resource management

-   **Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) 2**: Invest in resilient water supply infrastructure

-   **Water, Sanitation & Hygiene (WASH) 3**: Develop groundwater sustainably

-   **Water Resource Management**: Implement comprehensive strategies to manage water resources effectively and ensure access to clean and safe water for all by 2025

-   **Water Management**: Improve water resource management to ensure water security and quality

-   **Target 1**: By 2030, Participatory spatial planning and effective management across terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas will be ensured.

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **Target 7**: By 2030, reduce 50% of plastic, excess nutrients, and pesticide pollution into terrestrial, coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems taking into account food security, human health, and livelihoods

-   **Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **Target 11**: By 2030, nature's contributions to people including provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are restored maintained, and enhanced

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

-   **Objective 7 (Adaptation)**: Adopt integrated water resources management (e.g., reduce leakages, promote rainwater harvesting, regulate abstraction).

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 42 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl3)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
