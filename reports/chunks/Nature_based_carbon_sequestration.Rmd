The AI model identified 11 targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **LDN Target 2**: Restore and improve degraded forest (80% in the dry zone and 20% in the wet zone)

-   **LDN Target 3**: Increase forest cover from 29% to 32%

-   **LDN Target 4**: Reduce rate of soil degradation to improve land productivity and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks



​

**NBSAP targets**:

-   **NBT 2**: Ensure that by 2030 at least 30% of degraded terrestrial, inland waters, coastal, and marine ecosystems are identified and under appropriate restoration initiatives including enhanced connectivity and buffering, using relevant methods, recovery plans, monitoring, adequate resources, and inter-agency cooperation, to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity, and connectivity

-   **NBT 8**: Minimize the impact of climate change on all levels of biodiversity, and increase their resilience through mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and habitat conservation; supported by nature-based solutions, and ecosystem-based approaches, while minimizing negative and fostering positive impacts of climate action on biodiversity

-   **NBT 10**: Ensure that areas under agriculture, aquaculture, fisheries, mining, tourism, renewable energy generation, and forestry are managed sustainably and cause minimum impact on ecosystems and wild species; promoting food security, all forms of nature-based tourism; conserving and restoring biodiversity, and maintaining ecosystem functions and services to benefit people

-   **NBT 11**: Restore, maintain and enhance nature’s contributions to people, such as ecosystem functions and services, by the use of nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches, for the benefit of all people and nature



​

**NDC targets**:

-   **Forestry NDC 1**: Sustainable management of forest and restoration of other degraded lands, at least 32% by 2035

-   **Forestry NDC 2**: Expansion, restoration, and sustainable management of trees outside forest (TROF)

-   **Forestry NDC 3**: Promote catchment protection in major rivers and cascade systems through tree planting

-   **Forestry NDC 4**: Conservation and enhancement of blue carbon ecosystems including mangroves, sea grass, salt marsh.

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Land degradation (LDN), all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP), and all targets that pertain to Climate Change (NDC). Of these, 36 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl11)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets across the Land Degradation Neutrality Targets for Sri Lanka, the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC), and the Nature-Based Targets (NBT) exhibit significant alignment in their focus on enhancing forest cover and restoring degraded ecosystems. For instance, both the NDC and Land Degradation Neutrality Targets emphasize sustainable management and restoration of forests, with specific goals of increasing forest cover and improving degraded lands. Additionally, the NBT targets complement these efforts by advocating for the restoration of various ecosystems, thereby enhancing biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, while the NDC sets a specific timeline for achieving a 32% restoration by 2035, the NBT targets emphasize broader restoration initiatives by 2030, indicating a potential area for synchronization in timelines and methodologies. Overall, these policies collectively support the theme of nature-based carbon sequestration through integrated restoration and sustainable management practices.
