The AI model identified 12 targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 5 (Mitigation)**: Decrease the deforestation rate by 20% from baseline (~469,420 ha/year), restoring 2 million ha of degraded forests

-   **Forestry 3**: Support research on forest resilience

-   **Forestry 2**: Engage in afforestation/reforestation

-   **Forestry 3**: Support large-scale forest landscape restoration

-   **Supporting Measures 2**: Use market (CDM, REDD+) & non-market mechanisms

-   **Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **Reforestation Initiative**: Increase forest cover by reforesting 15,000 hectares annually

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **Target 11**: By 2030, nature's contributions to people including provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are restored maintained, and enhanced

-   **Objective 8 (Mitigation)**: Scale up community-based forest management, afforestation, and REDD+ initiatives to reduce deforestation pressures.

-   **Forest Restoration**: Restore natural green cover across the island

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 44 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl8)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
