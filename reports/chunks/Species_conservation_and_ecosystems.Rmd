#### Species conservation and ecosystems

This includes halting human-induced extinction of species, controlling invasive alien species, sharing of genetic resources and their digital sequence information to ensure genetic diversity, and reducing human-wildlife conflict, for instance, creating reserves. This also includes ecosystem services and ecosystem-based adaptation across deserts, forests, grasslands, shrublands, tropical rainforests, oceans, coral reefs, lakes, marine coastal ecosystems, rivers, savanna, woodlands, sub-tropical, wetlands, and other biomes.

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 234 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl11)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
