::: {custom-style="Text"}
This **Pilot Nature-Climate Alignment Assessment** is developed through Artificial Intelligence (AI) to support `r params$country` in evaluating the alignment between nature and climate targets at the national level. Bringing together expertise across the UNDP Nature Hub, Climate Hub, and pilot countries, the methodology seeks to uncover similarities, locate nature-based solutions, identify quantitative information, and provide a starting point for decision-making towards policy coherence. Targets from `r params$country`'s `r txt_documents` shared by the country and found in **\@ref(anx1)** form the basis for the analysis.

<br>

The **Nature-Climate Alignment Assessment** offers four custom national analysis:
:::

::: {custom-style="bullet-point"}
-   **Locate Nature-Based Solutions**: Analyze the integration of nature-based solutions within national climate and biodiversity targets.

-   **Identify Thematic Overlaps**: Assess common cross-cutting themes across targets.

-   **Evaluate Target-Level Similarities**: Pinpoint specific targets across biodiversity and climate policies show opportunities for greater alignment.

-   Assess **Quantitative Information**: Provide information quantitative and time-bound elements of targets, such as “protect 30% of biodiversity” or “achieve by 2030”.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
The pilot results are intended to provide Parties with guiding information towards:
:::

::: {custom-style="bullet-point"}
-   **Enhancing Policy Coherence**: Providing actionable insights for aligning nature and climate targets, as well as other targets a country may find relevant.

-   **Fostering Stakeholder Engagement**: Supporting inclusive and participatory processes and strengthening inter-institutional coordination, pursuing whole-of-government and society approaches.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
Given that this assessment is produced, through AI, it is bound by certain limitations (**Table 1.\@ref(tab:tbl1)**). Countries are strongly encouraged to use these results as a conversation starter rather than prescriptive stand-alone analysis. It is recommended to carefully review results with relevant stakeholders and consider them alongside other types of nationally validated analysis and desk reviews. As part of the pilot process, and to ensure a human-centered approach, `r params$country` is invited to provide feedback on the methodology and the presentation of the results through an [`r ftext("open survey", links)`](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Xtvls0QpN0iZ9XSIrOVDGWNp7QxCnxtBnoa-dEHQqQxUMlIxV0FOSzdWTkFCMUJFTFFFMFc4UFNURy4u). This will support further refinements to scale up the approach to support all interested countries to align their policy targets.

## Background {#sec12}

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and desertification are interlinked crises that require integrated action. Ecosystem health depends on stable climate conditions. Climate change is one of the major drivers of biodiversity loss and land degradation, with anthropogenic climate-induced warming potentially threatening as many as one in six species of flora and fauna around the globe, according to [`r ftext("Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPEBS)", links)`](https://www.ipbes.net/models-drivers-biodiversity-ecosystem-change). Biodiversity is also a critical part of the solution to climate change. Nature-based solutions, such as reforestation, coastal restoration, and soil management, can help counteract human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and provide over [`r ftext("30% of the solution needed", links)`](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1710465114#supplementary-materials) to ensure global warming does not increase 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels. According to the [`r ftext("Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)", links)`](https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our success in limiting climate change is dependent on enhanced mitigation from the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector, which accounts for roughly 22% of global GHG emissions.

<br> 

The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) aim to address climate change, conserve biodiversity, and promote sustainable land management. These are often called the ‘Rio Conventions’ because they were established during the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. The conventions and their frameworks reflect the value of integrated action for nature, climate, and land. More information on the synergies between these conventions can be found in **\@ref(anx2)**.
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
Through integrated planning and implementation of national policy instruments such as National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) for the CBD, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) for the UNFCCC, and Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) targets for the UNCCD, countries can optimize resources and ensure coherent approaches to global nature, climate, and land crises. Cohesive policies across sectors can also streamline reporting and enhance transparency.  

<br>

Converging timelines in 2024 and 2025 for national planning towards the Rio Conventions present a unique window to align nature and climate policies. Although NBSAPs, updated in line with the KMGBF, were requested by the CBD COP16 in 2024, many countries are still developing these documents into 2025. Similarly, while countries were requested to submit NDCs 3.0 to the Secretariat of the UNFCCC by February 2025, some countries plan to finalize by the end of 2025. These intersecting timeframes can facilitate harmonized efforts towards planning across conventions. However, despite the fact that [`r ftext("153 out of 198 Parties have national focal points for two or all three Rio Conventions within the same ministry", links)`](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Infobrief%202_design%20a.pdf), planning processes can often be siloed and overlook the importance of synergies, resulting in fragmented efforts and missed opportunities for integrated action.  

<br>

Given the urgency for rapid action, AI can provide a helpful starting point for discussion and planning among decision-makers. When applied through a human-centered approach, AI can democratize access to cutting-edge analytics and empower a broader range of stakeholders. In 2024, over 50 countries piloted the use of AI to conduct assessments of alignment between their national and global biodiversity targets to achieve CBD commitments. Developed by UNDP under the Early Action Support Project and funded by the Global Environment Facility, [`r ftext("NBSAP Target Similarity Assessments", links)`](https://www.undp.org/publications/leveraging-artificial-intelligence-enhance-early-action-towards-kunming-montreal-global-biodiversity-framework) offer customized insights on synergies between national biodiversity targets and the KM-GBF targets. These assessments also provide recommendations for enhanced alignment to bring about a transformation in our societies’ relationship with biodiversity by 2030. UNDP is now building on this original methodology to support countries in developing assessments of alignment between their national policy targets. This also links with ongoing work to support countries with their NDC revision and NBSAP update processes through UNDP's Nature Hub and Climate Hub.

<br>

For this assessment, countries were invited to share the national policy targets that they consider most relevant for analysis, including those related to NBSAPs, NDC, NAPs, and LDN targets, in addition to other national plans. In this case, the term “target” is used as an umbrella term for any type of concise national objective or aim that strives to support achievement of the Rio Conventions, as well as any other goals that a country deems relevant. Often a target may have a quantitative element, such as “Restore ***60%*** of degraded forest, wetland, and coastal ecosystems ***by 2030*** to enhance biodiversity and carbon sequestration.” However, this is not the case for all targets. Given that the guidelines for national planning towards the Rio Conventions differ greatly, there may be great variability in how countries choose to define their targets for this assessment.

In addition to alignment between national targets and categories such as the nature-based solutions and cross-cutting themes, the AI model also identified opportunities for more alignment _between_ targets. As seen in **Figure 2.\@ref(fig:fig4)**, when comparing the country's nature targets from the `r nat_docs` with the country's climate targets from the `r cli_docs`, the model found **`r sum(dta_th$generated_sample)` opportunities for alignment**. This means that these targets, although they come from different policy documents, could be candidates for further alignment in their development, implementation, and/or reporting. **Sections \@ref(sec31)** and **\@ref(sec32)** explore these opportunities further and outline more alignment between these targets could be beneficial.

Defining explicit numerical targets, such as safeguarding a specific percentage or number of terrestrial or marine ecosystems, is pivotal for establishing and monitoring progress toward clear conservation and climate benchmarks. Equally, assigning specific timelines for achieving these targets ensures a structured and time-sensitive approach, fostering a sense of urgency and facilitating systematic progress monitoring.

It is recommended that countries review these results and, if helpful, use them to support stakeholder engagement for policy planning, implementation, or reporting processes.

"What nature-based solutions are present across the targets? Did the analysis miss anything? Are the targets measurable and inclusive?", 
"Are there additional themes that you would like to cross-check between the targets?", 
"Which national policies appear to be the most aligned with each other and where are there gaps?", 
"How could the country’s policy targets be updated to improve coherence?", 
"Are there ways that the implementation of targets across different conventions could be done simultaneously for enhanced impact and reporting?"))

## Nature-based solutions {#sec31}

::: {custom-style="Text"}
The UNEA defines [`r ftext("nature-based solutions", links)`](https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/39864/NATURE-BASED%20SOLUTIONS%20FOR%20SUPPORTING%20SUSTAINABLE%20DEVELOPMENT.%20English.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) as actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human wellbeing, ecosystem services and resilience and biodiversity benefits.  

<br>

This analysis looked for eleven types of nature-based solutions that pertain to climate change adaptation and mitigation. At the recommendation of a UNDP working group, these nature-based solutions were sourced from the [`r ftext("IPCC Special report on Climate Change and Land", links)`](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/) and [`r ftext("Natural Climate Solutions", links)`](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1710465114) by Griscom et al. A description of the methodology can be found in **\@ref(anx3)**. The Nature4Climate's [`r ftext("Guide for including nature in Nationally Determined Contributions", links)`](https://nature4climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/N4C-Guide-Nature-NDCs.pdf) includes suggestions for the review of NDC targets that might be useful to consider alongside this analysis.

<br>

In total, the following targets appear to pertain to at least one nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


::: {custom-style="bullet-point"}
`r txt_nbs_cnt`
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
The nature-based solution categories that appear most referenced across the targets are `r aux1$Theme[dim(aux1)[1]]`, and `r aux1$Theme[dim(aux1)[1]-1]`. In addition, the nature-based solution categories that appear least referenced are `r aux1$Theme[1]` and `r aux1$Theme[2]`. Questions for consideration when reviewing the results can be found in the Nature4Climate's [`r ftext("Guide for including nature in Nationally Determined Contributions", links)`](https://nature4climate.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/N4C-Guide-Nature-NDCs.pdf)

*In the feedback [`r ftext("survey", links)`](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=Xtvls0QpN0iZ9XSIrOVDGWNp7QxCnxtBnoa-dEHQqQxUMlIxV0FOSzdWTkFCMUJFTFFFMFc4UFNURy4u), countries are requested to provide information on if the assessment is too generous or restrictive in certain areas.*

# Quantitative information {#sec4}

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
Defining explicit numerical targets, such as safeguarding a specific percentage or number of terrestrial or marine ecosystems, is pivotal for establishing and monitoring progress toward clear conservation and climate benchmarks. Equally, assigning specific timelines for achieving these targets ensures a structured and time-sensitive approach, fostering a sense of urgency and facilitating systematic progress monitoring. Countries are encouraged to ensure that their targets are "S.M.A.R.T.", which stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. 
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
In total, `r round(100*sum(count_qt$QUANT)/dim(tgts)[1],0)`% of the `r if (nrow(tgts) < 10) {as.character(as.english(nrow(tgts)))} else {nrow(tgts)}` targets appear to be quantitative (`r txt_qtq`), meaning that these targets may be more specific and measurable than others. Of the quantitative targets, those that pertain to `r "{{fill}}"`, while those of the LT-LEDS are more connected to `r "{{fill}}"`.

<br>

In addition, `r round(100*sum(count_qt$DATE)/dim(tgts)[1],0)`% of all `r if (nrow(tgts) < 10) {as.character(as.english(nrow(tgts)))} else {nrow(tgts)}` targets appear to be time-bound (`r txt_qtt`). Of the time-bound targets, the `r "{{fill}}"`, while those of `r "{{fill}}"`. The country might find it valuable to consider aligning timeframes across its policies.

Considerations for `r params$country` and additional considerations

In this section, the country is encouraged to provide its own reflection on the results and provide suggestions within the context of the country’s NDC update process. Gaps could be highlighted from the assessment, as well as further considerations. For example, recommendations could focus on aligning measures and targets for easier funding and implementation, avoiding overlap of activities and double funding.

### Background on policy coherence between Rio Conventions {-#anx2}

::: {custom-style="Text"}
Policy coherence between the UNFCCC, UNCBD, and UNCCD is widely acknowledged as critical for the achievement of the conventions, given the implicit connections between nature, climate, and land. Countries are encouraged to consider synergies across these conventions and build strategies that can work hand-in-hand to maximize impact, decrease costs, and reduce trade-offs.

For example, the KMGBF of the CBD emphasizes climate change mitigation and adaptation as a pathway towards reducing biodiversity loss. In Target 2 of the KMGBF, countries committed to restoring 30% of all degraded ecosystems and in Target 8 countries agreed to minimizing the impacts of climate change and on biodiversity and build resilience by 2030.

<br>

Similarly, the Paris Agreement of the UNFCCC recognizes the importance of biodiversity in climate actions. For example, Article 5 highlights the need to protect and enhance forests as carbon sinks, supporting REDD+ initiatives. Article 7 promotes ecosystem-based adaptation to enhance climate resilience, while Article 4 encourages countries to integrate nature-based solutions into their N NDCs. At the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27), reference to nature-based solutions was included in a COP cover decision, and at COP29, the importance of biodiversity-positive climate finance and ecosystem restoration was emphasized, further strengthening awareness of the value in alignment between climate action and biodiversity conservation.

<br>

Finally, the UNCCD highlights the need to integrate biodiversity conservation into sustainable land management practices (Article 4) while Article 10 focuses on providing financial resources to support land restoration, which directly benefits biodiversity. The UNCCD 2018–2030 Strategic Framework emphasizes Nature-Based Solutions for land restoration, benefiting both ecosystems and biodiversity. The LDN goal underscores the need for restoring biodiversity through land rehabilitation.

<br>

The importance of integrated action towards was emphasized by the Presidents of UNCBD COP15, UNCCD COP15, and UNFCCC COP27 in 2023 in a [`r ftext("joint statement", links)`](https://www.cbd.int/sites/default/files/2023-11/JointStatement-UNCCDCOP15-CBDCOP15-UNFCCC-COP27-Presidents2023.pdf) calling on Parties to collectively work to advance the intertwined objectives of the Rio Conventions in accordance with respective mandates of each Convention to ensure a sustainable future for humanity and the planet. At Sixth Session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA-6) in 2024, a joint resolution was established on [`r ftext("promoting synergies, cooperation or collaboration for national implementation of multilateral environmental agreements and other relevant environmental instruments", links)`](https://docs.un.org/en/UNEP/EA.6/RES.4). At the CBD COP16 in October 2024, Parties to the CBD also agreed on a [`r ftext("Biodiversity and Climate decision", links)`](https://www.cbd.int/doc/decisions/cop-16/cop-16-dec-22-en.pdf), which recognizes the interlinkages between nature and climate crisis and urges countries to promote synergies in planning processes with the UNFCCC.

### Methodology {-#anx3}

Overview of the Analytical Approach

::: {custom-style="Text"}
This assessment uses Large Language Models, specifically GPT-4o mini, and Natural Language Processing to identify synergies, overlaps, and gaps between a country’s chosen targets. Four types of analysis are employed to provide an overview of alignment between relevant targets and understand the existence of quantitative and time-bound measures. The pilot approaches were developed and refined based on feedback from a UNDP working group and introductory discussions with countries. Countries are invited to provide additional input to refine the approaches further. 
:::

<br>

Nature-Based Solutions

::: {custom-style="Text"}
The objective of this analysis is to assess the integration of nature-based solutions across nature, climate, and land degradation policies.

<br>

**Approach**:
:::

::: {custom-style="Text"}
1. Identification of relevant nature-based solutions through a UNDP working group. These nature-based solutions were identified from the [`r ftext("IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land", links)`](https://www.ipcc.ch/srccl/chapter/summary-for-policymakers/) and [`r ftext("Natural Climate Solutions", links)`](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1710465114) by Griscom et al.
2. Development of descriptions of each type of nature-based solution, as found below:
:::

<br>

```{r tbl_anx4, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tab.id="tbl_anx4", tab.cap.pre="Annex Table ", tab.lp="tbl_anx", tab.cap="Nature-based Solutions themes"}

thms %>% 
  filter(Area == "NbS") %>% 
  select(-Area) %>% 
  rename(`Theme Description` = Text) %>% 
  flextable(cwidth = c(1, 5)) %>% 
  #width(j = 1, width = 1.5) %>% 
  #width(j = 2, width = 1.5) %>% 
  bg(part = 'header', j = 1:2, bg = '#d3e1f1') %>% 
  color(part = 'header', j = 1:2, color = 'black') %>% 
  bold(part = 'header') %>% 
  hline(part = 'all') %>% 
  valign(valign = 'top') %>% 
  align(align = 'justify') %>%  
  #set_table_properties(width = 1, layout = 'autofit') %>% 
  set_table_properties(width = 0.95, layout = 'fixed')
```

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
3. Data cleaning by replacing acronyms with their full text and removing country names from the data set.
4. Application of the GPT-4o mini model on UNDP’s secure Azure account to assess whether these nature-based solutions are represented in each of the climate and land degradation targets.
5. Assessment of opportunities for alignment among targets in each category.
:::

<br>

Cross-cutting themes

::: {custom-style="Text"}
The objective is to identify where seven additional themes are found across targets. These themes represent common elements across both policy types that can stimulate stakeholder conversation towards strong policy alignment.

<br>

**Approach**:
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
1. Identification of relevant themes pertaining to the Rio Conventions through a UNDP working group and discussions with countries.
2. Developed descriptions of each theme, as found below:

**Quantitative and time-bound analysis**

<br>

This analysis aims to identify quantitative metrics in the policy targets. These include time-bound references, such as "by 2030", or specific benchmarks for achievement, such as "reduce by 50%". These can support enhanced planning, implementation, and monitoring of targets.

<br>

**Approach**:
:::

<br>

::: {custom-style="Text"}
1. Undertake data cleaning by replacing acronyms with their full text and removing country names from the data set.
2. Use Natural Language Processing to break down targets into individual tokens, such as words, numbers, or punctuation marks, and identify both their token role and their contextual grammatical role, such as verb, adjective, and noun. With the combination of both roles, time-bound and numerical benchmark elements in each target can be properly identified. For example, this helps differentiate numbers in titles, such as "Article 2" or "National Plan 2025", from numeric indicators, such as “create 2 more protected areas” or “restore 60% of degraded areas”.
