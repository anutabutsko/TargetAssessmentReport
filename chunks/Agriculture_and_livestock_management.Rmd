<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 4 (Adaptation)**: Ensure that ≥ 50% of agricultural land under climate-smart practices (irrigation, drought-resilient seeds, crop diversification)

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Promote livestock resilience by adopting improved rangeland management in ≥ 40% of pastoral communities

-   **Agriculture 1**: Scale up climate-smart agriculture

-   **Livestock 1**: Strengthen climate-resilient rangeland management

-   **Livestock 3**: Enhance livestock productivity

-   **Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices to enhance food security and adapt to the impacts of climate change

-   **Target 4-3**: By 2030, the genetic diversity of cultivated plants and farmed and domesticated animals and of their wild relatives, including other socio-economically as well as culturally valuable species, is maintained

-   **Target 10-1**: By 2030, enhanced application of biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, fisheries aquaculture, and forestry for long-term productivity and support to food security and conservation.

-   **Target 10-2**: By 2030 agro-ecological practices including agroforestry and permaculture for local communities enhanced for improved crop productivity and food security.

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

-   **Objective 7 (Adaptation)**: Adopt integrated water resources management (e.g., reduce leakages, promote rainwater harvesting, regulate abstraction).

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 27 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl2)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
