The AI model identified five targets that could relate to this nature-based solution theme:
:::

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .



​

**Other targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 5**: Expansion of R&D on creation and introduction of biotechnological products and innovative technologies for food security (drought resistant and high-yielding animal species and breeds).

-   **BTR1 Target 6**: Radical improvement of public policies aimed at deepening reforms and measures to adapt to climate change, as well as measures to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, ensure rational use of natural resources and environmental protection.



​



**NDC targets**:

-   There are no targets identified that relate to this theme.

Of these, four pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl1)**). The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation..

**AI-generated summary – Agriculture and livestock management**

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in promoting sustainable agricultural practices and enhancing ecosystem services. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity into national policies and improving resource efficiency, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and environmental protection. For instance, the commitment to manage areas under agriculture sustainably aligns with efforts to mitigate the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region. While there is a shared focus on enhancing productivity and resilience in agricultural systems, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these goals, such as the emphasis on innovative financing in the National Biodiversity Targets. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for coordinated action in agriculture and livestock management.
