#### Sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions that promote inclusive, equitable, and environmentally sustainable development while ensuring that present needs are met without compromising the ability of future generations to meet theirs. It covers the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 SDGs, which integrate social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Efforts include poverty eradication, food and water security, universal access to education and healthcare, sustainable economic growth, sustainable infrastructure and urbanization, responsible consumption and production, access to clean energy, reduction of inequalities, promotion of peace, justice and strong institutions, and fostering partnerships. It also includes aligning national strategies with the SDGs, strengthening institutions to deliver on them, integrating SDG indicators into monitoring and reporting systems, ensuring policy coherence across sectors, and promoting cross-cutting solutions that address multiple goals simultaneously, including biodiversity conservation, climate action, and gender equality.

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
