-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 15**: By 2030, based on international best practice guidelines*, identify and initiate the development of legal, administrative, or policy measures needed in Uzbekistan to encourage and enable businesses, and in particular large and transnational companies and financial institutions, to progressively: reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, increase positive impacts, reduce biodiversity-related risks to business and financial institutions, promote actions to ensure sustainable patterns of production.

-   **CBD Target 16**: Improve progressively, through to 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation/biodiversity and ecosystem services loss, following the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

-   **CBD Target 18b**: By 2030 initiate substantive efforts to reduce, eliminate, phase out, or reform those subsidies and incentives that have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, including those in the energy, agriculture, infrastructure, mining, water, and land use sectors.

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.

-   **CBD Target 19c**: By 2030, establish a viable mechanism for retaining, earmarking and reinvesting public revenues and associated income streams in biodiversity conservation, at national and site levels.

-   **CBD Target 19d**: By 2030, develop and initiate on at least a pilot basis innovative biodiversity finance mechanisms that are generating new public revenues and private / community-level rewards, such as payments for ecosystem services, nature-themed bonds, biodiversity offsets and credits, nature-themed investment funds and financial products.

-   **CBD Target 20**: By 2030 all levels of the education, scientific research, and technical extension system in Uzbekistan ensures essential understanding of the role biodiversity and ecosystem service play in sustainable human development, and that practical capacity to apply that understanding, as appropriate to specific issues and within specific sectors, exists.

-   **CBD Target 21a**: To ensure through adequate and cost-effective spatial analysis, field monitoring, effective data processing, and subsequent effective presentation, that biodiversity and ecosystem services information and knowledge are accessible to decision-makers, practitioners, and the public, and it is used to guide effective and equitable governance, integrated and participatory management of biodiversity and maintenance of critical ecosystem services.

-   **CBD Target 22**: To strengthen and practically implement measures under the Aahus Convention Governments by 2030 that promote transparency, the rule of law, and good governance, as well as to effectively engage the public in decision-making on diverse environmental matters, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with its Sustainable Development Goals, including those on meeting biodiversity needs.

-   **CBD Target 23**: Ensure gender equality in the implementation of the Framework through a gender-responsive approach, where all women and girls have equal opportunity and capacity to contribute to the three objectives of the Convention, including by recognizing their equal rights and access to land and natural resources and their full, equitable, meaningful and informed participation and leadership at all levels of action, engagement, policy and decision-making related to biodiversity.



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

**AI-generated summary – Sustainable development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in promoting sustainable development and addressing climate change. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity into national policies and enhancing ecosystem services, particularly in the context of the Aral Sea region's environmental crisis. For instance, the commitment to ecological restoration and sustainable management of natural resources aligns with efforts to improve resource efficiency and mitigate climate impacts. While there is a shared focus on enhancing public policies and financial mechanisms for sustainability, some divergence is observed in the specific approaches to incentivizing biodiversity conservation and addressing agricultural productivity. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for cohesive action towards the SDGs.
