**AI-generated summary – Protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies demonstrate a strong alignment in promoting the sustainable management and restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity into national policies and highlight the need for ecosystem-based approaches to address climate change and environmental degradation. Notably, the National Biodiversity Targets advocate for the restoration of critical ecosystems, while other targets focus on mitigating the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region. Some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these goals, suggesting that further coordination could enhance synergies. Overall, the targets collectively support the overarching theme of protecting and restoring marine and coastal zones.
