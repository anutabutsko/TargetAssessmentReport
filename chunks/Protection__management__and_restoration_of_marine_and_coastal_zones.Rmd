**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 7 (Adaptation)**: Rehabilitate or sustainably manage ≥ 50% of degraded coastal zones (mangroves, reefs)

-   **Overall Resilience & Water Access 3**: Protect coastal communities/ecosystems from sea-level rise (conservative & worst-case scenarios)

-   **Coastal, Marine & Fisheries 1**: Strengthen coastal resource management

-   **Coastal, Marine & Fisheries 3**: Promote climate-smart fisheries/aquaculture

-   **No title:**: By 2030, the rate of biodiversity loss in marine, coastal, and inland waters reduced by 10% through effective planning and management

-   **Target 1**: By 2030, Participatory spatial planning and effective management across terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas will be ensured.

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **Target 4-1**: By 2030 genetic diversity of native, wild, and domesticated terrestrial, coastal and marine, and inland waters’ species loss is reduced by 30%.

-   **Target 7**: By 2030, reduce 50% of plastic, excess nutrients, and pesticide pollution into terrestrial, coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems taking into account food security, human health, and livelihoods

-   **Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **Objective 5 (Adaptation)**: Expand integrated coastal zone management, promoting mangrove restoration and shoreline vegetation buffers.

-   **Climate Change Impact Management**: Minimize pressures on coral reefs and vulnerable ecosystems due to climate change

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 50 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl1)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
