#### Desertification, drought, and land degradation

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions to address desertification and the effects of drought, especially in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. It also includes the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), which strives for a balance between land degradation and land restoration, ensuring that any land degradation is offset by the restoration of an equivalent area. Avoiding new degradation of land by maintaining existing healthy land, reducing existing degradation by adopting sustainable land management practices (i.e. Nature based Solutions), maintaining soil health, ramping up efforts to restore and return degraded lands to a natural or more productive state. This approach promotes long-term environmental sustainability, supports the restoration of ecosystem services, and contributes to the achievement of Rio Conventions global targets.

The AI model identified six targets that could relate to this nature-based solution theme:

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 1a**: By 2030 all areas of Uzbekistan are under a national system of participatory integrated spatial land and natural resource use planning at district level, that adequately considers and incorporates the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity values and ecosystem services, as part of wider sustainable development planning

-   **CBD Target 2**: By 2030 undertake the ecological restoration of at least 30% of degraded landscapes and ecosystems in Uzbekistan, with priority placed on those providing most critical ecosystem services and biodiversity values.

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.

**AI-generated summary – Desertification, drought, and land degradation**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies demonstrate a strong alignment in addressing desertification, drought, and land degradation. Both emphasize sustainable land management practices and the restoration of degraded ecosystems, with specific goals such as managing arable areas sustainably and undertaking ecological restoration of at least 30% of degraded landscapes. While there is general alignment on integrating biodiversity into national policies, some divergence is observed in the focus on renewable energy and innovative financing mechanisms. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for coordinated efforts to enhance ecosystem services and combat land degradation effectively.
