#### Desertification, drought, and land degradation

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions to address desertification and the effects of drought, especially in arid, semi-arid and dry sub-humid areas. It also includes the concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN), which strives for a balance between land degradation and land restoration, ensuring that any land degradation is offset by the restoration of an equivalent area. Avoiding new degradation of land by maintaining existing healthy land, reducing existing degradation by adopting sustainable land management practices (i.e. Nature based Solutions), maintaining soil health, ramping up efforts to restore and return degraded lands to a natural or more productive state. This approach promotes long-term environmental sustainability, supports the restoration of ecosystem services, and contributes to the achievement of Rio Conventions global targets.

The AI model identified seven targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 5 (Mitigation)**: Decrease the deforestation rate by 20% from baseline (~469,420 ha/year), restoring 2 million ha of degraded forests

-   **Agriculture 1**: Scale up climate-smart agriculture

-   **Livestock 1**: Strengthen climate-resilient rangeland management

-   **Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **Land Management**: Implement sustainable land management practices to halt land degradation

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 11 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl10)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
