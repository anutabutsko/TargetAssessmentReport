**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 15**: By 2030, based on international best practice guidelines*, identify and initiate the development of legal, administrative, or policy measures needed in Uzbekistan to encourage and enable businesses, and in particular large and transnational companies and financial institutions, to progressively: reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, increase positive impacts, reduce biodiversity-related risks to business and financial institutions, promote actions to ensure sustainable patterns of production.

-   **CBD Target 16**: Improve progressively, through to 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation/biodiversity and ecosystem services loss, following the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.



​

**Other targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

-   **BTR1 Target 6**: Radical improvement of public policies aimed at deepening reforms and measures to adapt to climate change, as well as measures to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, ensure rational use of natural resources and environmental protection.

**AI-generated summary – Value chain management**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in promoting sustainable practices within value chain management. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity into national policies and enhancing ecosystem services, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and resource efficiency. For instance, the commitment to sustainably manage agricultural and natural resources aligns with efforts to mitigate the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region. While there is a shared focus on improving resource efficiency and promoting sustainable practices, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these goals, such as the emphasis on innovative financing in the National Biodiversity Targets. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for cohesive policy implementation.
