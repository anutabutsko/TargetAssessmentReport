**AI-generated summary – Gender equality**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies demonstrate a strong alignment towards promoting gender equality and sustainable development. Both frameworks emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity considerations into national policies, with a focus on participatory approaches and ecosystem-based solutions. Notably, the National Biodiversity Targets advocate for sustainable management of natural resources, which resonates with the broader goals of improving public policies and addressing climate change impacts. While there is a shared commitment to enhancing ecosystem services and public engagement, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for implementation. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for cohesive action towards gender-responsive decision-making and sustainable resource management.
