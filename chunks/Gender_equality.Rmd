#### Gender equality

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes gender mainstreaming, gender-responsive decision-making, ensuring women’s rights and participation, reducing gender-based violence, and implementation of the KMGBF Gender Plan of Action, UNCCD Gender Action Plan, and the Lima work programme on gender.

The AI model identified five targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 5 (Cross-cutting)**: Gender mainstreaming in all climate actions, ensuring equitable participation and benefit-sharing

-   **Gender Mainstreaming**: Ensure adaptation actions address inequalities affecting women, youth, indigenous peoples, and other vulnerable groups

-   **Target 9**: By 2030, sustainably managed wild species and safeguard needs of the people including women, local communities, the poor, and vulnerable groups.

-   **Target 23-1**: By 2030, informed participation, leadership, and gender-responsiveness in biodiversity conservation and management improved

-   **Target 23-2**: By 2030, equal rights and access to land and natural resources enhanced.



​



**NA targets**:

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, six pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl14)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
