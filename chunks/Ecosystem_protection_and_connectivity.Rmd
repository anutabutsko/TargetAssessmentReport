#### Ecosystem protection and connectivity

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes establishing protected areas, community reserves, wildlife corridors, restore pollinator habitats, prevent species extinction, habitat rewilding, restricting invasive species and pests, ecosystem change detection, other effective conservation measures (OECM), and increased connectivity between protected areas.

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 1a**: By 2030 all areas of Uzbekistan are under a national system of participatory integrated spatial land and natural resource use planning at district level, that adequately considers and incorporates the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity values and ecosystem services, as part of wider sustainable development planning

-   **CBD Target 1b**: By 2030 all cities in Uzbekistan have “masterplans” for preservation and creation of “green areas” covering 30% of their territory that enhance both the living environment for people and conservation of biodiversity.

-   **CBD Target 2**: By 2030 undertake the ecological restoration of at least 30% of degraded landscapes and ecosystems in Uzbekistan, with priority placed on those providing most critical ecosystem services and biodiversity values.

-   **CBD Target 3**: Undertake urgent management actions to conserve species on the Uzbekistan Red List, with priority to those most threatened and endangered, through species-specific conservation action plans, establishment and effective management of ex-situ and re-introduction programmes (in-situ covered by Target 3), and establish mechanisms for minimising human/wildlife conflict.

-   **CBD Target 4**: By 2030 at least 30 percent of Uzbekistan’s terrestrial and inland water areas are effectively conserved and managed through ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed systems of protected areas (IUCN Cat. I-IV 0 20%) and other effective area-based conservation measures that will be developed and applied (additional 10%).

-   **CBD Target 6**: Establish effective mechanisms to reduce the introduction of invasive species to Uzbekistan by at least 50% by 2030, and ensure control of already established invasive species in order to minimize economic losses and impacts to biodiversity

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 9**: Ensure by 2030 that wild species and aesthetically high value natural landscapes of Uzbekistan are used sustainably, in order to maximize the social, economic and environmental benefits for people (particularly rural populations most dependant on nature).

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 12**: By 2030 ensure that all city and urban populations in Uzbekistan has access to a high-quality area of “green and blue spaces” that improve human health and well-being and connection to nature, contributing to inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the conservation of national biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem functions and services

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.

-   **CBD Target 21a**: To ensure through adequate and cost-effective spatial analysis, field monitoring, effective data processing, and subsequent effective presentation, that biodiversity and ecosystem services information and knowledge are accessible to decision-makers, practitioners, and the public, and it is used to guide effective and equitable governance, integrated and participatory management of biodiversity and maintenance of critical ecosystem services.

**AI-generated summary – Ecosystem protection and connectivity**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies demonstrate a strong alignment towards ecosystem protection and connectivity. Both sets emphasize the importance of sustainable land management, ecological restoration, and the integration of biodiversity into national policies. For instance, the commitment to restore 30% of degraded landscapes aligns with broader efforts to mitigate environmental crises, particularly in the Aral Sea region. While there is general alignment on promoting biodiversity and ecosystem services, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these goals, such as the focus on innovative financing in the National Biodiversity Targets versus broader policy reforms in other targets. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for cohesive action towards sustainable development.
