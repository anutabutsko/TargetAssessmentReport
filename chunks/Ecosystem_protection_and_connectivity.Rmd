-   **Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **No title:**: By 2030, the rate of biodiversity loss in marine, coastal, and inland waters reduced by 10% through effective planning and management

-   **Target 1**: By 2030, Participatory spatial planning and effective management across terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas will be ensured.

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **Target 4-1**: By 2030 genetic diversity of native, wild, and domesticated terrestrial, coastal and marine, and inland waters’ species loss is reduced by 30%.

-   **Target 4-2**: By 2030 the extinction of known threatened species is prevented and their conservation status, particularly of those most in decline, is improved and sustained.

-   **Target 5-1**: Safe, ethical, and sustainable legal harvesting and trade of wild flora and fauna (terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine) to enhance ecological integrity by 2030.

-   **Target 6**: Reduce the rates of introduction of invasive alien species by 50% and minimize their impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services by 2030

-   **Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **Target 10-1**: By 2030, enhanced application of biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, fisheries aquaculture, and forestry for long-term productivity and support to food security and conservation.

-   **Target 11**: By 2030, nature's contributions to people including provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are restored maintained, and enhanced

-   **Investment in Biodiversity**: Increase investments in biodiversity conservation through sustainable practices

-   **Pollution and Habitat Protection**: Reduce habitat degradation and pollution levels, manage invasive species

-   **Governance and Participation**: Develop the Zanzibar Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan with effective community participation and respect for traditional knowledge in biodiversity conservation

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 90 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl4)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
