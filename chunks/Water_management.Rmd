The AI model identified nine targets that could relate to this nature-based solution theme:
:::

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 1a**: By 2030 all areas of Uzbekistan are under a national system of participatory integrated spatial land and natural resource use planning at district level, that adequately considers and incorporates the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity values and ecosystem services, as part of wider sustainable development planning

-   **CBD Target 4**: By 2030 at least 30 percent of Uzbekistan’s terrestrial and inland water areas are effectively conserved and managed through ecologically representative, well-connected and equitably governed systems of protected areas (IUCN Cat. I-IV 0 20%) and other effective area-based conservation measures that will be developed and applied (additional 10%).

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 18b**: By 2030 initiate substantive efforts to reduce, eliminate, phase out, or reform those subsidies and incentives that have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, including those in the energy, agriculture, infrastructure, mining, water, and land use sectors.



​

**Other targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

-   **BTR1 Target 3**: Accelerate the development of the national economy and ensure energy saving and active introduction of green economy technologies (Target 31: Implement the water resources management reform and water conservation program, including saving at least 7 billion m3 of water through efficient water use)

-   **BTR1 Target 7**: Increase irrigation system efficiency and water availability, conserve resources and increase the area under water-saving technologies to 2 million hectares, improve land reclamation and reduce salinization of arable land. Develop cooperation to ensure security in the context of global climate change in the Central Asia Region

**AI-generated summary – Water management**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in their focus on sustainable water management and ecosystem restoration. Both policies emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity values into national planning and resource management, particularly in the context of the Aral Sea crisis. For instance, the National Biodiversity Targets aim for sustainable management of agricultural and aquatic areas, which resonates with the Other targets' goals of improving water efficiency and resource conservation. While there is a shared commitment to enhancing ecosystem services and addressing climate change, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these objectives, suggesting opportunities for further integration and collaboration.
