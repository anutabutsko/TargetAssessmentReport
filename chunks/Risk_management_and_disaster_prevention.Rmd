The AI model identified three targets that could relate to this nature-based solution theme:
:::

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 6**: Establish effective mechanisms to reduce the introduction of invasive species to Uzbekistan by at least 50% by 2030, and ensure control of already established invasive species in order to minimize economic losses and impacts to biodiversity

-   **CBD Target 7**: Reduce pollution risks and the negative impact of pollution from all sources by 2030, to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, considering cumulative effects. Including pollution originating from agriculture (nutrients from fertilizer, pesticides, saline water), from industry (chemicals), and waste (sewage, other waste, particularly plastics).

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

**AI-generated summary – Risk management and disaster prevention**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies demonstrate a strong alignment in addressing risk management and disaster prevention, particularly through ecosystem-based approaches and sustainable land management practices. For instance, both emphasize the importance of enhancing nature's contributions to mitigate natural hazards and improve resilience in agricultural systems. While there is general alignment in promoting biodiversity integration into national policies, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for financing and implementing these initiatives. The focus on innovative financial mechanisms and public engagement in decision-making could further strengthen the synergies between these policies. Overall, the interconnectedness of these targets presents opportunities for cohesive action towards sustainable development in Uzbekistan.
