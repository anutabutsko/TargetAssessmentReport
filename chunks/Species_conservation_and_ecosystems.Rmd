-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 12**: By 2030 ensure that all city and urban populations in Uzbekistan has access to a high-quality area of “green and blue spaces” that improve human health and well-being and connection to nature, contributing to inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the conservation of national biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem functions and services

-   **CBD Target 13**: By 2030 identify and take any relevant or required actions to put in place in Uzbekistan the legal, policy, administrative and capacity-building measures at all levels, as appropriate, to ensure the fair and equitable sharing of benefits that arise from the utilization of genetic resources and from digital sequence information on genetic resources

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 15**: By 2030, based on international best practice guidelines*, identify and initiate the development of legal, administrative, or policy measures needed in Uzbekistan to encourage and enable businesses, and in particular large and transnational companies and financial institutions, to progressively: reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, increase positive impacts, reduce biodiversity-related risks to business and financial institutions, promote actions to ensure sustainable patterns of production.

-   **CBD Target 16**: Improve progressively, through to 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation/biodiversity and ecosystem services loss, following the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.

-   **CBD Target 18b**: By 2030 initiate substantive efforts to reduce, eliminate, phase out, or reform those subsidies and incentives that have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, including those in the energy, agriculture, infrastructure, mining, water, and land use sectors.

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.

-   **CBD Target 19c**: By 2030, establish a viable mechanism for retaining, earmarking and reinvesting public revenues and associated income streams in biodiversity conservation, at national and site levels.

-   **CBD Target 19d**: By 2030, develop and initiate on at least a pilot basis innovative biodiversity finance mechanisms that are generating new public revenues and private / community-level rewards, such as payments for ecosystem services, nature-themed bonds, biodiversity offsets and credits, nature-themed investment funds and financial products.

-   **CBD Target 20**: By 2030 all levels of the education, scientific research, and technical extension system in Uzbekistan ensures essential understanding of the role biodiversity and ecosystem service play in sustainable human development, and that practical capacity to apply that understanding, as appropriate to specific issues and within specific sectors, exists.

-   **CBD Target 21a**: To ensure through adequate and cost-effective spatial analysis, field monitoring, effective data processing, and subsequent effective presentation, that biodiversity and ecosystem services information and knowledge are accessible to decision-makers, practitioners, and the public, and it is used to guide effective and equitable governance, integrated and participatory management of biodiversity and maintenance of critical ecosystem services.



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

**AI-generated summary – Species conservation and ecosystems**

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in their focus on sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystem services. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity considerations into broader environmental policies, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and resource efficiency. For instance, the commitment to ecological restoration and sustainable land management is echoed across both sets of targets, highlighting a shared goal of enhancing ecosystem resilience. While there is a strong synergy in objectives, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for implementation, suggesting opportunities for further alignment and collaboration in achieving these shared goals.
