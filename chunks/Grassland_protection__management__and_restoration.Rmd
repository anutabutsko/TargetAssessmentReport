The AI model identified nine targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **NBSAP Target 1**: By 2030, Participatory spatial planning and effective management across terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas will be ensured.

-   **NBSAP Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **NBSAP Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **NBSAP Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **NBSAP Target 11**: By 2030, nature's contributions to people including provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are restored maintained, and enhanced



​

**NDC targets**:

-   **NDC Livestock 1**: Strengthen climate-resilient rangeland management



​

**Other targets**:

-   **NCCRS Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Promote livestock resilience by adopting improved rangeland management in ≥ 40% of pastoral communities

-   **NCCRS Objective 7 (Adaptation)**: Rehabilitate or sustainably manage ≥ 50% of degraded coastal zones (mangroves, reefs)

-   **NEMP Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (NCCRS, NDC and ZCCS), all targets that pertain to Other (TNFYDP, CCMEM, NBPIS, NDMS, NSWMS, NEMP, NECT, DGLDZ and BFP), and all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP). Of these, 13 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl6)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

**AI-generated summary – Grassland protection, management, and restoration**

The analysis of targets related to grassland protection, management, and restoration reveals several opportunities for alignment across different policies. Notably, the NDC targets emphasizing climate-resilient rangeland management align with various biodiversity targets focused on effective management and restoration of ecosystems. For instance, the commitment to restore and enhance ecosystems across degraded landscapes resonates with multiple biodiversity targets aimed at effective restoration and conservation of critical areas. Additionally, the emphasis on participatory spatial planning in biodiversity targets complements the NDC's focus on rangeland management. Overall, these synergies suggest a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem integrity and resilience, although some targets do not appear to have direct connections.
