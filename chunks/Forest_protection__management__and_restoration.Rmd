**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **NBSAP Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **NBSAP Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **NBSAP Target 10-1**: By 2030, enhanced application of biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, fisheries aquaculture, and forestry for long-term productivity and support to food security and conservation.

-   **NBSAP Target 10-2**: By 2030 agro-ecological practices including agroforestry and permaculture for local communities enhanced for improved crop productivity and food security.



​

**NDC targets**:

-   **NDC Forestry A1**: Enhance participatory forest management

-   **NDC Forestry A3**: Support research on forest resilience

-   **NDC Forestry M1**: Implement participatory forest management & conservation

-   **NDC Forestry M2**: Engage in afforestation/reforestation

-   **NDC Forestry M3**: Support large-scale forest landscape restoration

-   **NDC Supporting Measures 2**: Use market (CDM, REDD+) & non-market mechanisms



​

**Other targets**:

-   **NCCRS Objective 5 (Mitigation)**: Decrease the deforestation rate by 20% from baseline (~469,420 ha/year), restoring 2 million ha of degraded forests

-   **TNFYDP Wildlife Conservation Strategies**: Develop and implement strategies to combat poaching, illegal harvesting, and trade of wildlife, forest, bee, and antiquities resources in the country

-   **CCMEM Environmental Protection and Sustainability**: Enforce environmental laws and regulations to protect forests, rivers, and wildlife from illegal exploitation and ensure sustainable use of natural resources

-   **NEMP Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **NEMP Reforestation Initiative**: Increase forest cover by reforesting 15,000 hectares annually

-   **ZCCS Objective 6 (Adaptation) (CCS)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

-   **ZCCS Objective 8 (Mitigation) (CCS)**: Scale up community-based forest management, afforestation, and REDD+ initiatives to reduce deforestation pressures.

-   **DGLDZ Forest Restoration**: Restore natural green cover across the island

-   **DGLDZ Community Forestry**: Enhance community participation in forestry conservation

-   **DGLDZ Tree Nursery Management**: Develop and strengthen tree nurseries management

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (NCCRS, NDC and ZCCS), all targets that pertain to Other (TNFYDP, CCMEM, NBPIS, NDMS, NSWMS, NEMP, NECT, DGLDZ and BFP), and all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP). Of these, 70 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl4)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

**AI-generated summary – Forest protection, management, and restoration**

The analysis of targets related to forest protection, management, and restoration reveals significant alignment opportunities across the NDC targets, National Biodiversity Targets, and Other targets. Notably, the emphasis on enhancing participatory forest management and community participation in forestry conservation is a common thread, suggesting a potential for synergistic implementation. Additionally, targets focused on afforestation/reforestation and ecosystem restoration align well with biodiversity-friendly practices, indicating a cohesive approach to improving forest health and biodiversity. However, while there are strong connections, some targets do not appear to have direct counterparts in other policies, which could be an area for further exploration to enhance overall coherence in forest management strategies.
