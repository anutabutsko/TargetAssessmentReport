<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 7**: Reduce pollution risks and the negative impact of pollution from all sources by 2030, to levels that are not harmful to biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, considering cumulative effects. Including pollution originating from agriculture (nutrients from fertilizer, pesticides, saline water), from industry (chemicals), and waste (sewage, other waste, particularly plastics).

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 12**: By 2030 ensure that all city and urban populations in Uzbekistan has access to a high-quality area of “green and blue spaces” that improve human health and well-being and connection to nature, contributing to inclusive and sustainable urbanization, the conservation of national biodiversity and the provision of ecosystem functions and services

-   **CBD Target 15**: By 2030, based on international best practice guidelines*, identify and initiate the development of legal, administrative, or policy measures needed in Uzbekistan to encourage and enable businesses, and in particular large and transnational companies and financial institutions, to progressively: reduce negative impacts on biodiversity, increase positive impacts, reduce biodiversity-related risks to business and financial institutions, promote actions to ensure sustainable patterns of production.

-   **CBD Target 16**: Improve progressively, through to 2030, global resource efficiency in consumption and production and endeavour to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation/biodiversity and ecosystem services loss, following the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

-   **BTR1 Target 6**: Radical improvement of public policies aimed at deepening reforms and measures to adapt to climate change, as well as measures to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, ensure rational use of natural resources and environmental protection.



​



**NDC targets**:

**AI-generated summary – Pollution**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in addressing pollution and environmental sustainability. Both policies emphasize the importance of sustainable management of agricultural and natural resources, with a focus on enhancing ecosystem services and biodiversity. For instance, the National Biodiversity Targets aim to restore and maintain nature's contributions, which resonates with the Other targets' commitment to mitigating environmental crises, particularly in the Aral Sea region. While there is general alignment in promoting sustainable practices, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for implementation, such as the emphasis on innovative financing in the National Biodiversity Targets. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for integrated approaches to pollution reduction and sustainable development.
