The AI model identified nine targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 6 (Mitigation)**: Develop modern waste management in all major urban centers (3R—reduce, reuse, recycle) and pilot waste-to-energy projects

-   **Waste Management 1**: Enhance reuse/reduce/recycle (3R) practices

-   **Waste Management 2**: Develop waste-to-energy programs & landfill gas recovery

-   **Ecosystem Stability Enhancement**: Promote integrated pest management (IPM) and environmental impact assessments (EIA) for beekeeping areas to enhance ecosystem stability

-   **Waste Reduction Target**: Achieve 30% waste reduction through recycling and reuse by 2025

-   **Hazardous Waste Treatment Expansion**: Increase hazardous waste treatment facilities to handle all generated hazardous waste by 2025

-   **Waste Separation Initiative**: Develop and implement waste separation at source in 50% of municipalities by 2025

-   **Target 7**: By 2030, reduce 50% of plastic, excess nutrients, and pesticide pollution into terrestrial, coastal, marine, and freshwater ecosystems taking into account food security, human health, and livelihoods

-   **Pollution and Habitat Protection**: Reduce habitat degradation and pollution levels, manage invasive species

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, nine pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl13)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
