The AI model identified seven targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:
:::

<br>


**LDN targets**:

-   **Agriculture 1**: Scale up climate-smart agriculture

-   **Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **Land Management**: Implement sustainable land management practices to halt land degradation

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 10-1**: By 2030, enhanced application of biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, fisheries aquaculture, and forestry for long-term productivity and support to food security and conservation.

-   **Target 10-2**: By 2030 agro-ecological practices including agroforestry and permaculture for local communities enhanced for improved crop productivity and food security.

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 14 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl5)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
