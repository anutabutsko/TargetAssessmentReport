The AI model identified four targets that could relate to this nature-based solution theme:
:::

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

**AI-generated summary – Soil fertility management and restoration**

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and other policies exhibit significant alignment in their focus on sustainable land management and ecosystem restoration. Both emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity values into national policies and enhancing ecosystem services, particularly in the context of climate change adaptation and land degradation. For instance, the commitment to manage areas under agriculture sustainably aligns with broader goals of improving resource efficiency and mitigating environmental crises, such as those affecting the Aral Sea region. While there is a shared emphasis on ecosystem-based approaches, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for achieving these goals, suggesting opportunities for further integration and collaboration across policies.
