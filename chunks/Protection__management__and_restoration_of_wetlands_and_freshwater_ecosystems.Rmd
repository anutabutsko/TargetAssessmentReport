The AI model identified eight targets that could relate to this nature-based solution category:

<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **NBSAP Target 1**: By 2030, Participatory spatial planning and effective management across terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas will be ensured.

-   **NBSAP Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **NBSAP Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **NBSAP Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.



​

**NDC targets**:

-   **NDC Livestock 1**: Strengthen climate-resilient rangeland management



​

**Other targets**:

-   **NCCRS Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Promote livestock resilience by adopting improved rangeland management in ≥ 40% of pastoral communities

-   **NEMP Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **BFP Investment in Biodiversity**: Increase investments in biodiversity conservation through sustainable practices

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (NCCRS, NDC and ZCCS), all targets that pertain to Other (TNFYDP, CCMEM, NBPIS, NDMS, NSWMS, NEMP, NECT, DGLDZ and BFP), and all targets that pertain to Nature (NBSAP). Of these, 14 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl5)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation).

**AI-generated summary – Protection, management, and restoration of wetlands and freshwater ecosystems**

The analysis of targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of wetlands and freshwater ecosystems reveals several opportunities for alignment across different policies. Notably, the NDC target to strengthen climate-resilient rangeland management aligns with multiple targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets, particularly those focused on ecosystem restoration and sustainable practices. The emphasis on participatory spatial planning and effective management in the National Biodiversity Targets complements the goals of restoring degraded landscapes and increasing investments in biodiversity conservation. Overall, these synergies suggest a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem integrity and resilience, although some targets do not appear to have direct connections with others, indicating potential areas for further integration.
