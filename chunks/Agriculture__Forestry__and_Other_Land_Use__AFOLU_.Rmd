<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 1a**: By 2030 all areas of Uzbekistan are under a national system of participatory integrated spatial land and natural resource use planning at district level, that adequately considers and incorporates the restoration and maintenance of biodiversity values and ecosystem services, as part of wider sustainable development planning

-   **CBD Target 2**: By 2030 undertake the ecological restoration of at least 30% of degraded landscapes and ecosystems in Uzbekistan, with priority placed on those providing most critical ecosystem services and biodiversity values.

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 18b**: By 2030 initiate substantive efforts to reduce, eliminate, phase out, or reform those subsidies and incentives that have the greatest negative impacts on biodiversity, including those in the energy, agriculture, infrastructure, mining, water, and land use sectors.

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

-   **BTR1 Target 6**: Radical improvement of public policies aimed at deepening reforms and measures to adapt to climate change, as well as measures to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, ensure rational use of natural resources and environmental protection.

**AI-generated summary – Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU)**

The targets from the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in their focus on sustainable land management, ecosystem restoration, and climate change adaptation within the AFOLU theme. Both policies emphasize the importance of integrating biodiversity considerations into broader environmental and economic strategies, highlighting a shared commitment to enhancing ecosystem services and resilience. Notably, the National Biodiversity Targets aim for specific ecological restoration goals, while the Other targets stress the need for international cooperation and innovative financial mechanisms to support these efforts. While there is a strong synergy in objectives, the approaches to implementation and specific metrics may vary, suggesting opportunities for further alignment and collaboration.
