**LDN targets**:

-   **Objective 4 (Adaptation)**: Ensure that ≥ 50% of agricultural land under climate-smart practices (irrigation, drought-resilient seeds, crop diversification)

-   **Objective 5 (Mitigation)**: Decrease the deforestation rate by 20% from baseline (~469,420 ha/year), restoring 2 million ha of degraded forests

-   **Agriculture 1**: Scale up climate-smart agriculture

-   **Forestry 1**: Enhance participatory forest management

-   **Forestry 1**: Implement participatory forest management & conservation

-   **Forestry 2**: Engage in afforestation/reforestation

-   **Forestry 3**: Support large-scale forest landscape restoration

-   **Supporting Measures 2**: Use market (CDM, REDD+) & non-market mechanisms

-   **Environmental Protection and Sustainability**: Enforce environmental laws and regulations to protect forests, rivers, and wildlife from illegal exploitation and ensure sustainable use of natural resources

-   **Climate-Resilient Agriculture**: Promote climate-resilient agricultural practices to enhance food security and adapt to the impacts of climate change

-   **Ecosystem Restoration**: Restore and enhance ecosystems across all degraded landscapes

-   **Land Management**: Implement sustainable land management practices to halt land degradation

-   **Reforestation Initiative**: Increase forest cover by reforesting 15,000 hectares annually

-   **Target 2**: By 2030, ensure that at least 30% of areas of degraded terrestrial, inland water and coastal and marine ecosystems are under effective restoration in order to enhance biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services, ecological integrity and connectivity

-   **Target 3**: By 2030 at least 40% of terrestrial, inland waters, wetlands, coastal and marine areas important for biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services are effectively conserved and managed.

-   **Target 8**: Minimized impact of climate change on terrestrial, freshwater, coastal, and marine habitats, and other vulnerable ecosystems to maintain their integrity and build resilience by 2030.

-   **Target 10-1**: By 2030, enhanced application of biodiversity-friendly practices in agriculture, fisheries aquaculture, and forestry for long-term productivity and support to food security and conservation.

-   **Target 10-2**: By 2030 agro-ecological practices including agroforestry and permaculture for local communities enhanced for improved crop productivity and food security.

-   **Target 11**: By 2030, nature's contributions to people including provisioning and regulating ecosystem services are restored maintained, and enhanced

-   **Objective 6 (Adaptation)**: Implement climate-smart agriculture (e.g., soil & water conservation, agroforestry, improved seeds, irrigation).

-   **Objective 8 (Mitigation)**: Scale up community-based forest management, afforestation, and REDD+ initiatives to reduce deforestation pressures.

-   **Community Forestry**: Enhance community participation in forestry conservation

-   **Investment in Biodiversity**: Increase investments in biodiversity conservation through sustainable practices

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 125 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl12)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
