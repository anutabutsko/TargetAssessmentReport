#### Climate change adaptation and mitigation

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions that help reduce vulnerability to the current or expected impacts of climate change (climate resilience) and prevent global warming from reaching 1.5º Celsius about pre-industrial levels. This can include climate rusk assessments, building flood defenses, strengthening infrastructure, critical systems, essential services and human settlements, switching to drought-resistant crops, diversifying food production and sources, blue carbon, reducing GHG emissions, recycling, using renewable energy (solar, wind, green hydrogen, waste and others), reducing carbon footprint, expanding low-carbon technology, electrifying transportation, adopting non-motorized transportation, using sustainable or low-carbon fuel, minimizing loss and damage, expand climate forecasting infrastructure, decarbonization, create carbon sinks, and conduct carbon removal, capture and storage.

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **NDC2 Target 1**: Increase the share of renewable energy sources to 25% of total power generation



​

**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 1**: Improving energy efficiency and the use of natural resources, the energy efficiency of the basic sectors of the economy, diversification of energy resources consumption, and development of using renewable energy sources.

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.

-   **BTR1 Target 4**: Creation of innovative technologies for production, storage and use of an alternative and environmentally friendly energy source (green hydrogen in the field of RE development).

-   **BTR1 Target 6**: Radical improvement of public policies aimed at deepening reforms and measures to adapt to climate change, as well as measures to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector, ensure rational use of natural resources and environmental protection.

-   **BTR1 Target 7**: Increase irrigation system efficiency and water availability, conserve resources and increase the area under water-saving technologies to 2 million hectares, improve land reclamation and reduce salinization of arable land. Develop cooperation to ensure security in the context of global climate change in the Central Asia Region

**AI-generated summary – Climate change adaptation and mitigation**

The targets across the NDC and National Biodiversity policies exhibit significant alignment, particularly in promoting renewable energy and enhancing ecosystem services. For instance, the NDC target to increase renewable energy share aligns with biodiversity goals focused on restoring ecosystem functions and integrating biodiversity into national policies. Additionally, both policies emphasize sustainable management of agricultural and natural resources, highlighting a shared commitment to resilience against climate change impacts. However, some divergence is observed in the specific approaches to achieving these goals, with the National Biodiversity Targets placing a stronger emphasis on ecosystem-based solutions. Overall, there are clear opportunities for synergistic implementation that could enhance both climate adaptation and mitigation efforts.
