#### Climate change adaptation and mitigation

::: {custom-style='Citation'}
This includes actions that help reduce vulnerability to the current or expected impacts of climate change (climate resilience) and prevent global warming from reaching 1.5º Celsius about pre-industrial levels. This can include climate risk assessments, building flood defences, strengthening infrastructure, critical systems, essential services and human settlements, switching to drought-resistant crops, diversifying food production and sources, blue carbon, reducing GHG emissions, recycling, using renewable energy (solar, wind, green hydrogen, waste and others), reducing carbon footprint, expanding low-carbon technology, electrifying transportation, adopting non-motorized transportation, using sustainable or low-carbon fuel, minimizing loss and damage, expand climate forecasting infrastructure, decarbonization, create carbon sinks, and conduct carbon removal, capture and storage.

The AI model also compared all targets that pertain to Climate (LDN), all targets that pertain to Other (LDN), and all targets that pertain to Nature (LDN). Of these, 247 pairs show opportunities for further alignment with each other (, as shown in **Table 3.\@ref(tab:tbl9)**. The country might want to explore these targets in more detail and consider areas for further alignment or aligned implementation.).

The targets related to the protection, management, and restoration of marine and coastal zones exhibit significant alignment opportunities across different frameworks. Notably, the NDC targets focusing on protecting coastal communities from sea-level rise align with several National Biodiversity Targets aimed at reducing biodiversity loss and ensuring effective management of marine ecosystems. Additionally, the emphasis on strengthening coastal resource management in the NDC targets complements the National Biodiversity Targets that advocate for participatory spatial planning and restoration efforts. Furthermore, the promotion of climate-smart fisheries within the NDC framework aligns with biodiversity conservation goals, highlighting a cohesive approach to enhancing ecosystem resilience. Overall, these synergies suggest a robust framework for integrated coastal management and restoration initiatives.
