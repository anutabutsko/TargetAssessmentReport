<br>


**National Biodiversity Targets**:

-   **CBD Target 2**: By 2030 undertake the ecological restoration of at least 30% of degraded landscapes and ecosystems in Uzbekistan, with priority placed on those providing most critical ecosystem services and biodiversity values.

-   **CBD Target 8**: Ensure the efficient and effective integration and synergistic implementation of the interlinked issues of climate change adaption, combatting land degradation and biodiversity/ecosystem services conservation through active integration and intergovernmental coordination of actions and the prioritization of “ecosystem-based” approaches” to addressing these fundamental threats to Uzbekistan sustainable development.

-   **CBD Target 10**: By 2030 areas under arable agriculture, pasture, forestry, and fisheries will be managed sustainably and the increased productivity of such areas will be achieved through the utilization of sound ecologically based best practices, thereby ensuring resilience and long-term efficiency and productivity of these production systems, and to food security, conserving and restoring biodiversity and maintaining nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services.

-   **CBD Target 11**: Restore, maintain, and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as the regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination, and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through nature-based solutions and/or ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature

-   **CBD Target 14**: Ensure the full integration of biodiversity and its multiple values into all relevant national policies, regulations, planning, and development processes, in particular those with significant impacts and high synergies with biodiversity (land degradation, climate change adaption, water and agriculture, and rural socio-economic development, etc.), progressively aligning all relevant public and private activities, and fiscal and financial flows with the goals and targets of the National Biodiversity Strategy .

-   **CBD Target 18c**: By 2030 scale up positive incentives that support biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, including those that target government-run and private/community-level protected and conserved areas, sustainable land management, nature-positive business, nature-based and ecosystem-based solutions, and infrastructure.



​

**Other targets**:

-   **BTR1 Target 2**: Taking measures to mitigate the effects of the environmental crisis in the Aral Sea region and strengthening international cooperation in the field of green economy with the participation of IFIs. Adapting to and mitigating climate change, improving the efficiency of natural resource use and preserving natural ecosystems; developing financial and non-financial mechanisms to support the green economy.



​



**NDC targets**:

**AI-generated summary – Nature-based carbon sequestration**

The targets across the National Biodiversity Targets and Other targets exhibit significant alignment in promoting nature-based carbon sequestration strategies. Both emphasize the importance of sustainable management of agricultural, forestry, and fisheries areas, aiming for enhanced productivity while conserving biodiversity. Notably, the integration of biodiversity into national policies is a common theme, suggesting a holistic approach to environmental challenges. While there is general alignment in objectives, some divergence is observed in the specific mechanisms proposed for implementation, particularly regarding financial and technological innovations. Overall, these synergies present opportunities for coordinated efforts in enhancing ecosystem services and addressing climate change impacts effectively.
