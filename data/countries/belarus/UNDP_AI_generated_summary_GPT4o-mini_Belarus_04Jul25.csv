7,Gender equality,"The analysis of gender equality targets across various policies reveals meaningful synergies, particularly in the areas of gender mainstreaming and women's participation. For instance, both the KMGBF Gender Plan of Action and the UNCCD Gender Action Plan emphasize the importance of gender-responsive decision-making, suggesting a shared commitment to integrating gender considerations into broader frameworks. While there is general alignment on reducing gender-based violence, some divergence is observed in the specific strategies proposed by different policies. The Lima work programme on gender further complements these efforts by focusing on implementation mechanisms. Overall, the NDC, KMGBF Gender Plan of Action, UNCCD Gender Action Plan, and the Lima work programme on gender present opportunities for cohesive action towards achieving gender equality targets."
8,Grassland management and protection,"The analysis of grassland management and protection targets reveals meaningful synergies across various policies. The NDC and National Biodiversity Targets emphasize sustainable grazing and grassland restoration, aligning closely with the objectives of the Land Use Policy, which focuses on avoiding grassland conversion and promoting conservation agriculture. While there is general alignment in the commitment to optimal grazing intensity and avoiding desertification, some divergence is observed in the specific approaches to tree intercropping and degraded land restoration. The integration of these targets could enhance overall effectiveness in achieving grassland protection and management goals. Overall, the policies present a cohesive framework for addressing grassland sustainability, with opportunities for further alignment."
9,Nature-based carbon sequestration,"The analysis reveals significant alignment between the NDC and National Biodiversity Targets, particularly in their shared emphasis on increasing forest cover and enhancing biodiversity through restoration and sustainable management practices. Both policies advocate for afforestation and the sustainable use of forest resources, indicating a cohesive approach to nature-based carbon sequestration.
