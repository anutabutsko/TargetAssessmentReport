At the governmental level, the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM), instituted by decree 11,550 of 5 June 2023, sets the institutional framework for the elaboration and implementation of public policies on climate change. CIM is currently working on the revision of the National Climate Change Policy and its sectorial mitigation and adaptation plans, including the regulation of the Brazilian Emissions Trading System, The institutional dialogue between the Brazilian government and civil society takes place
through the Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, instituted by decree 9,082, of 26 June 2017.
The Forum aims at raising “awareness and mobilize society and to contribute to the discussion of actions needed to deal with global climate change, in accordance with the National Policy on Climate Change, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its related international agreements, including the Paris Agreement and Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contributions”.
Articles 5, 231, and 232 of the Brazilian Constitution establish ample rights and guarantees for all Brazilian citizens, paying due attention to the special needs of women and indigenous peoples. Brazil is also a party to the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.

(ii) Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:
a. National circumstances, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication:
With a territory of over 8.5 million square kilometers, Brazil has equatorial, tropical, and subtropical climates with rainfall levels that range from 500 mm to 2.000 mm per year, as well
as six biomes, namely the Cerrado (savannah), the Amazon (equatorial rainforest), the Caatinga (semi-arid), the Atlantic Forest (tropical rainforest), the Pantanal (seasonal wetlands),
and the Pampa (subtropical grasslands). All of the six Brazilian biomes are subject to negative impacts of climate change, which will require the federal government to consider specific policies and measures to address their particularities when implementing this NDC.
Brazil has also signed all major multilateral environmental treaties and has enacted a wide range of laws and public policies regarding sustainable development. It has also worked to
implement policies aimed at fighting poverty and reducing vulnerabilities in areas such as health, education, social security and minimum income. Brazil currently ranks 87th among 190 countries in the latest United Nations Human Development Index ranking. Brazilian figures regarding social development point to the need to ensure economic growth while promoting improvements in the life standards of its population.
In 2022, the Brazilian population was 203 million, and national authorities project positive growth rates until 2050, when the country ́s population might reach 230 million.
Approximately 61% (84.4%) of the Brazilian population lives in urban areas, hence the urgent need for the government to implement specific policies and measures to ensure adequate conditions of sanitation and subsistence. Such concerns must be part of the implementation efforts of this NDC.
The agricultural sector plays a key role in the Brazilian economy and its pursuit of sustainable development. An increase in the global temperature interferes with the water levels and rainfall patterns in the different biomes, which, in turn, has the potential to harm the current levels of productivity and employment. Therefore, the Brazilian government considers it to be of the utmost importance to implement adaptation actions in this sector to tackle the perverse effects of climate change.
The Brazilian electric sector is among those with the highest share of renewable sources in its mix, which is largely due to the employment of hydropower. The negative impacts of climate change, including droughts and decreases in water levels, are taken into account by the federal government in the process of planning for mitigation and action to tackle climate change in the country.
b. Best practices and experience related to the preparation of the nationally determined contribution:
The current Brazilian NDC is the result of experience gained and lessons learned from the intended Nationally Determined Contribution (iNDC), submitted to the United Nations
Framework on Climate Change in 2015, and subsequent updates.

Both the ICTU component and the NBT acknowledge the importance of gender-responsive approaches. 
#Recommendations: The ICTU component could further align with the NBT by explicitly stating strategies and actions to raise awareness among the Brazilian people about the values of biodiversity and the steps they can take to conserve and use it sustainably. Additionally, the ICTU component could include specific measures to ensure the active participation of local communities and indigenous peoples in biodiversity conservation efforts.","Way too high (if looking at NDC rel. to NBT, okay-ish?)"

a. National circumstances, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication:
With a territory of over 8.5 million square kilometers, Brazil has equatorial, tropical, and subtropical climates with rainfall levels that range from 500 mm to 2.000 mm per year, as well
as six biomes, namely the Cerrado (savannah), the Amazon (equatorial rainforest), the Caatinga (semi-arid), the Atlantic Forest (tropical rainforest), the Pantanal (seasonal wetlands),
and the Pampa (subtropical grasslands). All of the six Brazilian biomes are subject to negative impacts of climate change, which will require the federal government to consider specific policies and measures to address their particularities when implementing this NDC.
Brazil has also signed all major multilateral environmental treaties and has enacted a wide range of laws and public policies regarding sustainable development. It has also worked to
implement policies aimed at fighting poverty and reducing vulnerabilities in areas such as health, education, social security and minimum income. Brazil currently ranks 87th among 190 countries in the latest United Nations Human Development Index ranking. Brazilian figures regarding social development point to the need to ensure economic growth while promoting improvements in the life standards of its population.
In 2022, the Brazilian population was 203 million, and national authorities project positive growth rates until 2050, when the country ́s population might reach 230 million.
Approximately 61% (84.4%) of the Brazilian population lives in urban areas, hence the urgent need for the government to implement specific policies and measures to ensure adequate conditions of sanitation and subsistence. Such concerns must be part of the implementation efforts of this NDC.
The agricultural sector plays a key role in the Brazilian economy and its pursuit of sustainable development. An increase in the global temperature interferes with the water levels and rainfall patterns in the different biomes, which, in turn, has the potential to harm the current levels of productivity and employment. Therefore, the Brazilian government considers it to be of the utmost importance to implement adaptation actions in this sector to tackle the perverse effects of climate change.
The Brazilian electric sector is among those with the highest share of renewable sources in its mix, which is largely due to the employment of hydropower.

Planning processes:,"(a) Information on the planning processes that the Party undertook to prepare its nationally determined contribution and, if available, on the Party’s implementation plans, including, as appropriate:","(i) Domestic institutional arrangements, public participation and engagement with local communities and indigenous peoples, in a gender-responsive manner:
At the governmental level, the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change (CIM), instituted by decree 11,550 of 5 June 2023, sets the institutional framework for the elaboration and implementation of public policies on climate change. CIM is currently working on the revision of the National Climate Change Policy and its sectorial mitigation and adaptation plans, including the regulation of the Brazilian Emissions Trading System, The institutional dialogue between the Brazilian government and civil society takes place
through the Brazilian Forum on Climate Change, instituted by decree 9,082, of 26 June 2017.
The Forum aims at raising “awareness and mobilize society and to contribute to the discussion of actions needed to deal with global climate change, in accordance with the National Policy on Climate Change, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its related international agreements, including the Paris Agreement and Brazil’s Nationally Determined Contributions”.
Articles 5, 231, and 232 of the Brazilian Constitution establish ample rights and guarantees for all Brazilian citizens, paying due attention to the special needs of women and indigenous peoples. Brazil is also a party to the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.

(ii) Contextual matters, including, inter alia, as appropriate:
a. National circumstances, such as geography, climate, economy, sustainable development and poverty eradication:
With a territory of over 8.5 million square kilometers, Brazil has equatorial, tropical, and subtropical climates with rainfall levels that range from 500 mm to 2.000 mm per year, as well
as six biomes, namely the Cerrado (savannah), the Amazon (equatorial rainforest), the Caatinga (semi-arid), the Atlantic Forest (tropical rainforest), the Pantanal (seasonal wetlands),
and the Pampa (subtropical grasslands). All of the six Brazilian biomes are subject to negative impacts of climate change, which will require the federal government to consider specific policies and measures to address their particularities when implementing this NDC.
Brazil has also signed all major multilateral environmental treaties and has enacted a wide range of laws and public policies regarding sustainable development. It has also worked to
implement policies aimed at fighting poverty and reducing vulnerabilities in areas such as health, education, social security and minimum income. Brazil currently ranks 87th among 190 countries in the latest United Nations Human Development Index ranking. Brazilian figures regarding social development point to the need to ensure economic growth while promoting improvements in the life standards of its population.
In 2022, the Brazilian population was 203 million, and national authorities project positive growth rates until 2050, when the country ́s population might reach 230 million.
Approximately 61% (84.4%) of the Brazilian population lives in urban areas, hence the urgent need for the government to implement specific policies and measures to ensure adequate conditions of sanitation and subsistence. Such concerns must be part of the implementation efforts of this NDC.
The agricultural sector plays a key role in the Brazilian economy and its pursuit of sustainable development. An increase in the global temperature interferes with the water levels and rainfall patterns in the different biomes, which, in turn, has the potential to harm the current levels of productivity and employment. Therefore, the Brazilian government considers it to be of the utmost importance to implement adaptation actions in this sector to tackle the perverse effects of climate change.
The Brazilian electric sector is among those with the highest share of renewable sources in its mix, which is largely due to the employment of hydropower. The negative impacts of climate change, including droughts and decreases in water levels, are taken into account by the federal government in the process of planning for mitigation and action to tackle climate change in the country.

The need to plan for adaptation to the effects of climate change has motivated Brazil to elaborate its National Adaptation Plan (NAP) in 2016, with the aim of promoting “the reduction
and management of climate risks considering the effects of climate change, by taking full advantage of emerging opportunities, avoiding losses and damages, and building instruments to prepare natural, human, productive and infrastructure systems to adapt to climate change”.
The Interministerial Committee on Climate Change is currently working on the revision of the National Climate Change Policy and its sectorial mitigation and adaptation plans. Thus, Brazil will develop a National Adaptation Strategy and 14 sectoral/thematic plans.",#0.000 #No identified similarity.,

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:,(a) How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:,"Brazil is a developing country and, as such, faces challenges associated with poverty eradication, the need to improve its development indexes in areas that include education, public
health, employment rates, housing and social inclusion. In spite of its challenges, Brazil has contributed greatly with the global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, thus proving that it is possible to decouple economic growth and emissions. 
In the pre-2020 period, the Brazilian government has voluntarily committed to implementing sectoral initiatives that taken together could reduce the projection of Brazilian emissions by 36.1-38.9% in 2020. In most of these sectors, Brazil has exceeded its expectations, having substantially increased the share of renewable sources in its energy mix and almost doubled the restored area of degraded lands.
The Brazilian NDC is one of the most ambitious in the world. Besides its targets, Brazil is one of the few countries that adopted a commitment for 2025 as well as 2030, which will provide for a better monitoring of the mitigation efforts throughout the decade. Brazil therefore understands that it is making an important contribution to international efforts to combat climate change in both absolute and relative terms.
Currently, 30% of the Brazilian territory is covered by protected areas, such as conservation units and indigenous lands. Brazilian environmental laws are among the most advanced in the world, given that they require landowners to preserve 20-80% of their lands and that they establish additional protective measures for fragile ecosystems. Together with the protected areas established under the Brazilian Forest Code, approximately 50-60% of the Brazilian territory is under some kind of protection. Despite this, the Brazilian government has chosen to go even beyond existing laws and policies and commit to reach zero deforestation by 2030, according to the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal
Amazon (PPCDAm). The Permanent Interministerial Commission for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation, established by the Decree 11,367/2023, will define and coordinate
interministerial actions to reduce deforestation rates in the national territory. Action Plans for each of the Brazilian biomes will be defined, having as reference PPCDAm, which is in its 5th phase of implementation.

Still regarding the land use sector, the Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan) has already channeled R$ 17 billion to implement a vast range of mitigation measures, which include
recovering degraded lands, projects of nitrogen fixation, increased accumulation of organic matter (carbon) in the soil, no-till farming, the integration of forest, crops and cattle breeding, agroforestry and forest planting. By 2020, the ABC Plan had exceeded its goals by 155%, and is to be continued, from 2020 to 2030, through the Sectoral Adaptation Plan for a Low Carbon Agriculture for Sustainable Development (Plan ABC+). It is a key policy among Brazilian sectoral efforts to tackle climate change.
Brazil has one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world. In 2020, renewable sources accounted for 48.4% of the total demand for energy, three times the world average. In the electricity demand mix, the share of renewables accounted for 84.8%. As for the transport mix, it represents 25% of the sources. The production of biofuels for the transport sector has substantially increased due to RenovaBio, which uses market incentives to promote the decarbonisation of the sector and to incentivize these kinds of fuels. The use of hydropower to generate electricity accounts for 60% of the national installed capacity and has proven to be the best available technology to compensate for the intermittency and seasonality that affect other sources of renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy, as well as biomass. Brazil has also made significant investments, nonetheless, in solar and wind energy and biomass, which already account for 20% of the country ́s energy mix and are experiencing rapid growth.
Regarding the issue of means of implementation, the Brazilian NDC remains unconditional, yet it welcomes support from developed countries, as well as South-South cooperation
initiatives on a complimentary basis, with a view to generate global benefits. The policies, measures and actions to achieve this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanism of the Convention or of any other modalities of climate finance, international cooperation and support.

recovering degraded lands, projects of nitrogen fixation, increased accumulation of organic matter (carbon) in the soil, no-till farming, the integration of forest, crops and cattle breeding, agroforestry and forest planting. By 2020, the ABC Plan had exceeded its goals by 155%, and is to be continued, from 2020 to 2030, through the Sectoral Adaptation Plan for a Low Carbon Agriculture for Sustainable Development (Plan ABC+). It is a key policy among Brazilian sectoral efforts to tackle climate change.
Brazil has one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world. In 2020, renewable sources accounted for 48.4% of the total demand for energy, three times the world average. In the electricity demand mix, the share of renewables accounted for 84.8%. As for the transport mix, it represents 25% of the sources. The production of biofuels for the transport sector has substantially increased due to RenovaBio, which uses market incentives to promote the decarbonisation of the sector and to incentivize these kinds of fuels. The use of hydropower to generate electricity accounts for 60% of the national installed capacity and has proven to be the best available technology to compensate for the intermittency and seasonality that affect other sources of renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy, as well as biomass. Brazil has also made significant investments, nonetheless, in solar and wind energy and biomass, which already account for 20% of the country ́s energy mix and are experiencing rapid growth.
Regarding the issue of means of implementation, the Brazilian NDC remains unconditional, yet it welcomes support from developed countries, as well as South-South cooperation
initiatives on a complimentary basis, with a view to generate global benefits. The policies, measures and actions to achieve this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanism of the Convention or of any other modalities of climate finance, international cooperation and support.

recovering degraded lands, projects of nitrogen fixation, increased accumulation of organic matter (carbon) in the soil, no-till farming, the integration of forest, crops and cattle breeding, agroforestry and forest planting. By 2020, the ABC Plan had exceeded its goals by 155%, and is to be continued, from 2020 to 2030, through the Sectoral Adaptation Plan for a Low Carbon Agriculture for Sustainable Development (Plan ABC+). It is a key policy among Brazilian sectoral efforts to tackle climate change.
Brazil has one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world. In 2020, renewable sources accounted for 48.4% of the total demand for energy, three times the world average. In the electricity demand mix, the share of renewables accounted for 84.8%. As for the transport mix, it represents 25% of the sources. The production of biofuels for the transport sector has substantially increased due to RenovaBio, which uses market incentives to promote the decarbonisation of the sector and to incentivize these kinds of fuels. The use of hydropower to generate electricity accounts for 60% of the national installed capacity and has proven to be the best available technology to compensate for the intermittency and seasonality that affect other sources of renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy, as well as biomass. Brazil has also made significant investments, nonetheless, in solar and wind energy and biomass, which already account for 20% of the country ́s energy mix and are experiencing rapid growth.
Regarding the issue of means of implementation, the Brazilian NDC remains unconditional, yet it welcomes support from developed countries, as well as South-South cooperation
initiatives on a complimentary basis, with a view to generate global benefits. The policies, measures and actions to achieve this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanism of the Convention or of any other modalities of climate finance, international cooperation and support.

interministerial actions to reduce deforestation rates in the national territory. Action Plans for each of the Brazilian biomes will be defined, having as reference PPCDAm, which is in its 5th phase of implementation.

Still regarding the land use sector, the Low Carbon Agriculture Plan (ABC Plan) has already channeled R$ 17 billion to implement a vast range of mitigation measures, which include
recovering degraded lands, projects of nitrogen fixation, increased accumulation of organic matter (carbon) in the soil, no-till farming, the integration of forest, crops and cattle breeding, agroforestry and forest planting. By 2020, the ABC Plan had exceeded its goals by 155%, and is to be continued, from 2020 to 2030, through the Sectoral Adaptation Plan for a Low Carbon Agriculture for Sustainable Development (Plan ABC+). It is a key policy among Brazilian sectoral efforts to tackle climate change.
Brazil has one of the cleanest energy mixes in the world. In 2020, renewable sources accounted for 48.4% of the total demand for energy, three times the world average. In the electricity demand mix, the share of renewables accounted for 84.8%. As for the transport mix, it represents 25% of the sources. The production of biofuels for the transport sector has substantially increased due to RenovaBio, which uses market incentives to promote the decarbonisation of the sector and to incentivize these kinds of fuels. The use of hydropower to generate electricity accounts for 60% of the national installed capacity and has proven to be the best available technology to compensate for the intermittency and seasonality that affect other sources of renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy, as well as biomass. Brazil has also made significant investments, nonetheless, in solar and wind energy and biomass, which already account for 20% of the country ́s energy mix and are experiencing rapid growth.
Regarding the issue of means of implementation, the Brazilian NDC remains unconditional, yet it welcomes support from developed countries, as well as South-South cooperation
initiatives on a complimentary basis, with a view to generate global benefits. The policies, measures and actions to achieve this contribution will be implemented without prejudice to the use of the financial mechanism of the Convention or of any other modalities of climate finance, international cooperation and support.

How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:,(a) How the Party considers that its nationally determined contribution is fair and ambitious in the light of its national circumstances:,"Brazil is a developing country and, as such, faces challenges associated with poverty eradication, the need to improve its development indexes in areas that include education, public
health, employment rates, housing and social inclusion. In spite of its challenges, Brazil has contributed greatly with the global efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, thus proving that it is possible to decouple economic growth and emissions. 
In the pre-2020 period, the Brazilian government has voluntarily committed to implementing sectoral initiatives that taken together could reduce the projection of Brazilian emissions by 36.1-38.9% in 2020. In most of these sectors, Brazil has exceeded its expectations, having substantially increased the share of renewable sources in its energy mix and almost doubled the restored area of degraded lands.
The Brazilian NDC is one of the most ambitious in the world. Besides its targets, Brazil is one of the few countries that adopted a commitment for 2025 as well as 2030, which will provide for a better monitoring of the mitigation efforts throughout the decade. Brazil therefore understands that it is making an important contribution to international efforts to combat climate change in both absolute and relative terms.
Currently, 30% of the Brazilian territory is covered by protected areas, such as conservation units and indigenous lands. Brazilian environmental laws are among the most advanced in the world, given that they require landowners to preserve 20-80% of their lands and that they establish additional protective measures for fragile ecosystems. Together with the protected areas established under the Brazilian Forest Code, approximately 50-60% of the Brazilian territory is under some kind of protection. Despite this, the Brazilian government has chosen to go even beyond existing laws and policies and commit to reach zero deforestation by 2030, according to the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal

Current generations are bearing the costs of past interference with the global climate system, resulting from human activities and consequent greenhouse gas emissions, primarily by developed countries, during the last two and a half centuries. In order to build a fair global response to climate change, it is therefore of central importance to establish a connection between cause (anthropogenic emissions) and effect (temperature increase and climate change).
